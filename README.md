# Brother QL-X00 Print Service
A print service that receives a rastered image along with JSON parameters for the Brother QL-X00 printer series. 
```
X refers to the series. Like 8, 7, 6, etc.
```

> First let me point out, that to access a printer you need a language that can expose the bitwise operation. Recommended langugages include Python and Java. 
> In my research I found that NodeJS was not good solution by itself. Too many hurdles to overcome!
