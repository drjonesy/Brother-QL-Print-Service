# Brother-QL-Print-Service
A print service that receives a rastered image along with JSON parameters for the Brother QL-X00 printer series.

> First let me point out, that to access a printer you need a language that can expose the bitwise operation. Recommended langugages include Python and Java. 
> In my research I found that NodeJS was not good solution by itself. Too many hurdles to overcome!
